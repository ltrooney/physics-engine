objective: create a physics engine that could simulate 2-d motion and collisions.


needs to:
	* incorporate threading for refreshing
	* have an interactive GUI

function: 
	* engine updates with 30 times / second
	* at each update the equation are recalculated and
	  determine the changes for the next step.
	* measurements are calculated in SI units, but
	  are converted to pixels for distance measurements

Phase I) create simple GUI for the physics engine interface
Phase II) use kinematics equations to calculate the position of
		 the object in its trajectory
Phase III) add collision detection using conservation of momentum


issues:
	* resizing grid involves changing the PIXELS_PER_METER constant
	* doesn't show METERS_IN_X meters on the grid
